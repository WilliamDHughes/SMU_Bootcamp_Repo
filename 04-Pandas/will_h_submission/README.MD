Here is the completed code for the Pandas Challenge. 

First thing I noticed was that the higher the per-student spending, the lower the percentage of passing. This feels backwards. I expected a fairly strong positive correlation between the two but the data says the oposite. I would ask to see more data specifically regarding the breakdown of the budget. How much is going to teacher salaries? Technology in the classrooms? School lunches?

More predictably, Charter schools out-performed public schools by a huge margin, particularly in math. This wasn't surprising, what WAS surprising was the budgets (again). I fully expected to see Charter Schools spending much more per student.
