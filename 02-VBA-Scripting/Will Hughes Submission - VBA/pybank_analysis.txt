Analysis for Pybank Activity

For this analysis I wrote code that calculates the total change, the average, and the max and min changes. It then takes that information and writes it to a new text file. 

The average seemes to be trending down which indicates the company has overall been losing money which is generally considered to be bad news bears. 
Summer months appear to perform better than winter months. 
I tried and failed to read the .csv into a Jupyter Notebook and hit it with some matplotlib but I couldn't make it happen. I think it would have confirmed my summer/winter theory. 
Maybe the company sould start pushing initiaves to pick up more business in the winter months.
